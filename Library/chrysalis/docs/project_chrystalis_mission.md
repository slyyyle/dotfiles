## Philosophical Underpinning
The goal isn't technological replacement, but cognitive augmentation. Each utility example demonstrates how AI can serve as a collaborative intelligence amplifier, not a standalone solution.

## Ethical Consideration
Every utility example must prioritize:
- Human agency
- Transparent decision-making
- Preserving individual and collective autonomy

## Emerging Paradigm
We're not just developing a technology, but cultivating a new form of collaborative intelligence that respects and enhances human potential.
